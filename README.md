# working_with_twitter
Collection of notebooks written while learning to work with the Twitter API (https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal)

1. "twitter_API_intro" is my first attempt at retrieving Twitter data, and contains some detailed explanations on using tweepy to interact with the Twitter API.
2. "sentiment_twitter" is a naive sentiment analysis experiment on Italian tweets
3. "tweet_trends_viz" is a recap of my experiments in tracking Twitter trends in Italy, gather tweets for the top trends and then performing some data visualization on them.
